# train_time

This website allows users to enter in the name of a train, the destination, how often it returns to station, and the last time it was in station.
It then calculates when the train will arrive, and how many minutes away that it.
If two users have the site open at the same time, when one person enters in data, the other user will be able to see it as well.
Users must fill in all input boxes before hitting submit, or else they will receive an alert and the info will not submit.

This site is usable on all major browsers, although due to the use of firebase, it is recommended that users use google Chrome.
